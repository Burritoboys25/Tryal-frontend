        It all started with four best friends who met in college—connected by a shared sense of
        adventure and curiosity. After graduation, life took us in different directions, each of us
        moving across the country to start our careers. At first, it was exciting—new cities, new
        jobs, new routines. But as time passed, we found ourselves consumed by work and struggling
        to make time for the things that once made us feel alive.

        We realized we weren&apos;t alone. So many adults want to break out of their routine but
        don&apos;t know where to start. Finding new experiences can feel overwhelming—endless
        research, long-term commitments, and the uncertainty of stepping outside your comfort zone.
        That’s why we created Tryal—to remove the friction and make it easy to say “yes” to
        something new. Whether it&apos;s rediscovering a passion, trying a hobby for the first time,
        or simply making time for yourself, your next experience is waiting. Are you ready to
        rediscover yourself?
